# GC content calculator web app

I used the streamlit library to create a simple [GC content calculator](https://share.streamlit.io/alinasansevich/gc-content-calculator-web-app/main/GC_content_calculator_web_app.py). This is my first web app.

Once you have entered your sequence, you can take a look at the GC content distribution plot, locate the region you are more interested in and find each DNA-window's sequence with its GC content in the table below.

##### GC content distribution plot and results summary. You can expand the plot to view fullscreen, or save it by clicking on the 3 dots in the upper right corner.
